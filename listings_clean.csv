My home is a duplex with a private patio and small yard (not pictured).  It is a warm, cozy, and inviting space and offers great privacy.  You will be just a few short blocks from City Park featuring the Denver Zoo, Denver Museum of Nature & Science, and Gates Planetarium.  Great location for getting to many of Denver’s popular neighborhoods: RiNo, Uptown, Cap Hill!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You will have private access to the living room, kitchen, full bathroom, and 1 bedroom. This is my personal home, so my bedroom door will be locked to maintain privacy for my personal space, however I will never be staying in the home while guests are here.  There is a private patio (pictured) which I encourage you to use during your stay.  Please just be mindful of noise as it gets later in the day because there is a young family that lives in the next duplex.
